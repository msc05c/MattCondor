# Bio

My name is Matt Condor, and I am a software developer from Land O Lakes, FL. I am a native Floridian and grew up in the Land O Lakes area.  I've lived in the Greater Tampa Bay area, Tallahassee, and Gainesville. 

I went to Florida State University and got a Bachelor's of Arts in English Literature in 2009.  I had many jobs before getting into the field of software development, most jobs were in hospitality as a server or bartender.  My first job in software was in 2014 as a Support Specialist and I really enjoyed the work.  I went back to school for Information Technology while working in the field and graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Information Technology in 2019 from the University of South Florida. 

Outside of work I really enjoy spending time with friends and family.  I live with my girlfriend and our three dogs.  I enjoy working around the house, and usually have a few projects going on at any one time.  I also like to go on walks in the woods with our dogs, or taking my motorcycle out for some leisurely riding. I also love to get into a good movie or television show in the evenings.
